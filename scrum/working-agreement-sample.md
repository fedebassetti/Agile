#Working Agreement - sample

*[example](http://www.iliokb.com/2012/04/example-working-agreement.html)*

##Team

We agree to have conversations and to start them as early as possible. (Agile - "people over process").

We agree to make commitments as a team, we agree to work on commitments as a team.

We agree to review our processes and make changes as necessary.

We agree to use Confluence for documentation.


##Meetings

1. Meetings have agenda
1. Start on time (so show up on time)
1. End on time (and can end early)

###Daily Stand-up

We agree to follow daily stand-up guidelines:

* We will stand. [Why](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting)
* We will come Prepared to answer the [Three Questions](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/threeqs.html)
* If we are unable to attend the stand-up we will provide updates via the meeting notes Confluence page - answering the [Three Questions](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/threeqs.html)


##JIRA Board

###User Stories

A **user story** is an agreement to have a [conversation](http://www.strongandagile.co.uk/index.php/what-makes-a-good-user-story/) and as such we agree to not "throw tickets over the wall" but rather - discuss with the team and provide a way for all team members to be informed.

We agree to using the **User Story Template** and use Given-When-Then when writing Acceptance Criteria.

* http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/gwt.html

We agree that we will work on well defined stories that meet our [Definition of Ready](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/definition-of-ready.html).

###Ticket Life Cycle

We agree to follow the documented process for moving a ticket through it's life cycle so the JIRA board always reflects the most accurate information.

 * We agree to move tickets to QA as early as possible once they meet our [Definition of Done](http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/definition-of-done.html)

This process is documented on Confluence under the Process Documentation section.


###Current Sprint

We agree that we will work as a team to ensure that

* stories are well defined
* stories will be estimated
* stories will be prioritized (this will allow team to know what is upcoming)

We agree to work on only work on what is in the current sprint. We will not ignore the sprint or the priority ranking. If work for the current sprint has been completed early, or conversely - cannot be completed for some reason, a conversation to be had with the team.

###Backlog

We agree that it is expected that stories in the backlog are going to be incomplete, as User Stories are agreements to have a conversation and a ticket in the backlog will not have had that conversation yet.

We agree developers shall not pull stories out of the backlog and begin working on them. We will engage the team to determine what should be worked on next and ensure it follows the documented processes.

We agree to follow the process and honor priorities already in place for the current sprint.
