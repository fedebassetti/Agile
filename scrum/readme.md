#Scrum

##What is Scrum?

**Scrum** is a subset of **Agile**. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.

> A “process framework” is a particular set of practices that must be followed in order for a process to be consistent with the framework. (For example, the Scrum process framework requires the use of development cycles called Sprints, the XP framework requires pair programming, and so forth.)

>“Lightweight” means that the overhead of the process is kept as small as possible, to maximize the amount of productive time available for getting useful work done.

A **Scrum** process is distinguished from other agile processes by specific concepts and practices, divided into the three categories of Roles, Artifacts, and Time Boxes (or meetings).

##Learning Process

Another aspect of **Scrum** is that it is also a process for learning about the work that the team needs to do *and* the process the team uses to do it. **Time boxing** and **feedback loops** become essential to this aspect of **Scrum**.

In this case the term **time box** can refer to putting a set time limit on how long a development cycle will last, this should be no longer that 30 days - it is frequently two or three weeks.

> Software development has long been known to be troublesome when attempting to make all the decisions necessary for a product before any design is done or any code has been written for the product. Every day work is done on a product knowledge is gained. That makes the very first day of a project the day when the team knows the *least* about the product and chaos tends to ensue. **Time boxing** development cycles is an attempt to put that chaos in a box and make the most out of uncertainty by doing the smallest amount of work possible to have a functional product.

The **feedback loop** also helps us make the most of that uncertainty by encouraging the entire team to look at the result *and* the process used in the **time boxed** development cycle. The result is demonstrated to the product owner ([Sprint Review](meetings.md#review)) to ensure what is being delivered is what was asked for and if not it is adjusted for the next development cycle. The process is also reviewed ([Sprint Retrospective](meetings.md#retrospective)) and in this review the team looks at what obsticles came up in the development cycle and attempts to figure out how to overcome the obsticles in the next cycle. Time should also be taken in this meeting to point out what went well and encourage the team to keep doing those things.

> Instead of the "one phase and then the next" approach popularized by **waterfall** development, **Scrum** uses fixed length iterations (sprints) and incorporate each of the "phases" in **every** sprint. Every sprint contains many, if not all, of the 6 phases:

> * Requirements and analysis
* Design
* Code
* Integration
* Testing
* Deployments

##More differences from Waterfall

From the very first sprint a **Scrum** team tries to build a working, tested, and potentially releasable **product increment**.

At the end of every sprint the **product increment** is demoed to the product owner and any other interested stake holders. There seems to be a tendency in all of us, not just [product owners](./scrum/roles#product-owner) or customers, to need to see the wrong product first before we are better able to describe the right product.

The team does NOT need to "ship" every sprint, the [product owner](./scrum/roles#product-owner) makes that call, but the goal is for the cross-functional, self-organizeing team to work together to:

* understand business requirements
* designing, coding, and testing a solution
* integrate (and perhaps deploy) said solution

in order to meet the goal of a potentially releasable **product increment**.


It should be noted that design is not complete BEFORE the product development starts, design happens every sprint, continuous design and redesign as it is warranted, not before.

Also, testing does not happen at the END of product development - testing happens every sprint and during the sprint as possible, continuous testing.

##Challenges

**Scrum** brings challenges and is hard to practice. **Scrum** aims to reveal organizational impediments that can be fixed with courage and commitment.
In order to help make these corrections **Scrum** defines strict [Roles](roles.md), [Artifacts](artifacts.md), and [Time Boxes (or meetings)](meetings.md).
