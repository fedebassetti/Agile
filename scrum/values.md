#Scrum Values

All work performed in **Scrum** needs a set of values as the foundation for the team's processes and interactions. And by embracing these five values, the team makes them even more instrumental to its health and success.

##Focus

Because we focus on only a few things at a time, we work well together and produce excellent work. We deliver valuable items sooner.

##Courage

Because we work as a team, we feel supported and have more resources at our disposal. This gives us the courage to undertake greater challenges.

##Openness

As we work together, we express how we're doing, what's in our way, and our concerns so they can be addressed.

##Commitment

Because we have great control over our own destiny, we are more committed to success.

##Respect

As we work together, sharing successes and failures, we come to respect each other and to help each other become worthy of respect.
