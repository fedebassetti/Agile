#Time Boxing and Meetings

##Sprint
The heart of **Scrum** is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

Sprints contain and consist of the **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrums**, the development work, the **Sprint Review**, and the **Sprint Retrospective**.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Each Sprint should be used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to the cost associated with a small amount of time (two to four weeks).



##Sprint Planning

The work to be performed in the Sprint is planned at the Sprint Planning. This plan is created by the collaborative work of the entire Scrum Team.

Sprint Planning is time-boxed. The Scrum Master ensures that the event takes place and that attendants understand its purpose. The Scrum Master teaches the Scrum Team to keep it within the time-box.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

* What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?
* How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?

###Topic One: What can be done this Sprint?

The Product Owner discusses the objective that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed in the Sprint, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The entire Scrum Team collaborates on understanding the work of the Sprint.

The input to this meeting is:
* the Product Backlog
* the latest product Increment
* projected capacity of the Development Team during the Sprint
* past performance of the Development Team.

The number of items selected from the Product Backlog for the Sprint is solely up to the Development Team. Only the Development Team can assess what it can accomplish over the upcoming Sprint.

After the Development Team forecasts the Product Backlog items it will deliver in the Sprint, the Scrum Team crafts a Sprint Goal. The Sprint Goal is an objective that will be met within the Sprint through the implementation of the Product Backlog, and it provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.

###Topic Two: how will the chosen work get done?

Having set the Sprint Goal and selected the Product Backlog items for the Sprint, the Development Team decides how it will build this functionality into a “Done” product Increment during the Sprint. The Product Backlog items selected for this Sprint plus the plan for delivering them is called the Sprint Backlog.

Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less. The Development Team self-organizes to undertake the work in the Sprint Backlog, both during Sprint Planning and as needed throughout the Sprint.

The Product Owner can help to clarify the selected Product Backlog items and make trade-offs. If the Development Team determines it has too much or too little work, it may renegotiate the selected Product Backlog items with the Product Owner.

By the end of the Sprint Planning, the Development Team should be able to explain to the Product Owner and Scrum Master how it intends to work as a self-organizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment.

###Sprint Goal

The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment

As the Development Team works, it keeps the Sprint Goal in mind. In order to satisfy the Sprint Goal, it implements the functionality and technology. If the work turns out to be different than the Development Team expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate the scope of Sprint Backlog within the Sprint.

##Daily Stand-up

###Phase One: STATUS*
This phase should only take a few minutes, wherein each person attending quickly runs through [Three Questions](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-qs/) :

1. **Yesterday**: Here is what the team member worked on yesterday (since last stand-up): "I did/did not do what I said I would" (the "why" itself should be relegated to the next phase "I didn't get to ﻿**X** because of ﻿**Y** ﻿- we can discuss that more in parking lot")
1. **Today**: Here is the team member's plan for the day: "Today I plan on working on ticket number - ticket title description"
    2. Team members should give enough information to allow other team members to identify the work being proposed and be able to offer input if relevant (during parking lot), but not so much detail as to become a short story
    3. If a prior days work resulted in a blocker the "today" question can be answered something like: "I'll have a better idea of what I'm doing today after my blockers are addressed in the parking lot"
    4. Note that the plan for today should be fluid. If it is determined time would be better spent on something else then priorities can and should shift as necessary
1. **Blockers**: Here team members would mention items that are causing them to be unable to do work: "I can't move forward until I have access to the file system/database", "I've taken the piece I am working on is as far as I can take it - I cannot continue until another team member finishes their piece"
    2. This is something that immediately impacts the team member's progress for today
        3. This is not things that I need in a week or so - that can and should be handled in parking lot - or even in another meeting outside of the stand-up
    4. Blockers should **not** be discussed as they come up, but should be relegated to discussion during the **parking lot** phase.


###Phase Two: PARKING LOT

When the **general** (involves everyone) portion of the meeting is over the **targeted** portion of the meeting begins:

* At this point anyone not **directly** impacted by blockers or items that have been identified as parking lot items are **free to leave**. This keeps the meeting relevant to the smallest number of team members necessary and cuts back on team members attention wandering
    *  If possible the parking lot items should be addressed in a manner that continually dwindles the number of necessary team members
* The parking lot will often produce actionable items for team members. The action items should be followed up on during the day or at the next stand-up.


##Sprint Review

A Sprint Review is held at the end of the Sprint to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During the Sprint Review, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the Sprint. Based on that and any changes to the Product Backlog during the Sprint, attendees collaborate on the next things that could be done to optimize value. This is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and the presentation of the Increment is intended to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

The Sprint Review includes the following elements:

* Attendees include the Scrum Team and key stakeholders invited by the Product Owner
* The Development Team demonstrates the work that it has “Done” and answers questions about the Increment
* The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent Sprint Planning

The result of the Sprint Review is a revised Product Backlog that defines the probable Product Backlog items for the next Sprint. The Product Backlog may also be adjusted overall to meet new opportunities.


##Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

The Sprint Retrospective occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning.

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

* Figure out what worked well
* Figure out what did not work so well and how to keep that from happening again
* List items to keep doing or items to stop doing

By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.

##Backlog Grooming

Everyone attends the backlog refinement meeting: the team, the Product Owner, and the ScrumMaster. During the meeting, everyone helps prepare the Product Backlog for the sprint planning meeting. This usually includes adding new stories and epics, extracting stories from existing epics, and estimating effort for existing stories. Why is this helpful? Because a groomed backlog will help streamline sprint planning meetings; otherwise, they can stretch on for hours. When product backlog items contain clearly defined acceptance criteria and are estimated by the team members, the planning process does not have to be tense or overly long. By dedicating a time to backlog maintenance, the team ensures that this preliminary planning occurs prior to the sprint planning meeting.

Definition

The team (or part of the team including the product owner) meet regularly to "groom the product backlog", in a formal or informal meeting which can lead to any of the following:

removing user stories that no longer appear relevant
creating new user stories in response to newly discovered needs
re-assessing the relative priority of stories
assigning estimates to stories which have yet to receive one
correcting estimates in light of newly discovered information
splitting user stories which are high priority but too coarse grained to fit in an upcoming iteration

Also Known As
Other terms include "Story Time" (see timeline), "Backlog Refinement Meeting". The term reflects an organic approach to maintaining the backlog: the intended imagery is that of trimming, pruning, cleaning, as with a plant.

Expected Benefits
The intent of a "grooming" meeting is to ensure that the backlog remains populated with items that are relevant, detailed and estimated to a degree appropriate with their priority, and in keeping with current understanding of the project or product and its objectives. Unlike a more formal "requirements document" the backlog is understood as a dynamic body of information. For instance, not all user stories need to have been broken down to a fine-grained level at the onset of the project, or given detailed estimates; but it is important that at any moment a "sufficient" number of stories should be ready for scheduling in the next few iterations. An Agile project is, no less than any other, subject to "scope creep", in the form of user stories which do not really yield substantial value but were thought "good ideas at the time", and entered into the backlog lest they be forgotten. In the absence of explicit efforts aimed at managing this inflation, this inflation would result in the too well known pathologies of schedule and budget overruns.

##NOTE:*

The STATUS phase can easily end up being unproductive in several different ways - here are some [common unhelpful meeting types](https://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2014/july/7-mistakes-during-the-daily-stand-up-meeting) and some dos and don'ts:

###The "status report" meeting:
>**DO NOT** turn the daily meeting into a "status report" type meeting wherein each team member is reporting progress to the one person (team manager or Scrum Master)
>
>**DO** encourage the exchange to be on more of a peer-to-peer basis to facilitate team building and collaboration

###The "never ending" meeting:
>**DO NOT** allow or encourage team members to tell entire stories while answering the [Three Questions](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/three-qs/)
>
>**DO** interrupt with statements like "let's keep this moving" or "perhaps this is a parking lot item"

###The "no value" meeting:
>**DO NOT** allow the meeting to become a place where only one or two people actively contribute, this will lead to other team members simply getting bored, their attention wandering, or simply not attending
>
>**DO** structure the meeting so that relevant team members are present and able to leave once the first phase of the meeting is over
>
>**DO** remember one of the tenants of Agile is ["**Individuals and interactions** over process and tools"](http://agilemanifesto.org/) - conversation is encouraged so long as it is relegated to the proper phase of the meeting (or after)

###The "no problem" meeting
>**DO NOT** allow meetings to drop into a repetition of team members mumbling "no problems" - especially when peak performance is clearly not being achieved
>
>**DO** encourage impediments to be brought up in the group setting (at the appropriate time) so that the team can work as a whole solving the problem
