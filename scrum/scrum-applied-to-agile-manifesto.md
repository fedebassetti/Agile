#Scrum Applied to the Agile Manifesto

##Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

Scrum is a team-based approach to delivering value to the business. Team members work together to achieve a shared business goal. The Scrum framework promotes effective interaction between team members so the team delivers value to the business.

Once the team gets a business goal, it:

* Figures out how to do the work
* Does the work
* Identifies what's getting in its way
* Takes responsibility to resolve all the difficulties within its scope
* Works with other parts of the organization to resolve concerns outside their control

This focus on team responsibility in Scrum is critical.

##Working software over comprehensive documentation

Scrum requires a working, finished product increment as the primary result of every sprint. Whatever activities take place during the sprint, the focus is on the creation of the product increment. A Scrum team’s goal is to produce a product increment every sprint. The increment may not yet include enough functionality for the business to decide to ship it, but the team’s job is to ensure the functionality present is of shippable quality.

##Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Scrum is a framework designed to promote and facilitate collaboration. Team members collaborate with each other to find the best way to build and deliver the software, or other deliverables, to the business. The team, especially the product owner, collaborates with stakeholders to inspect and adapt the product vision so the product will be as valuable as possible.

##Responding to change over following a plan

Scrum teams make frequent plans. For starters, they plan the current sprint. In addition, many teams create longer-term plans, such as release plans and product roadmaps. These plans help the team and the business make decisions. However, the team’s goal is not to blindly follow the plan; the goal is to create value and embrace change. In essence, the thought process and ideas necessary for planning are more important than the plan itself.

A plan created early is based on less information than will be available in the future so, naturally, it may not be the best plan. As new information is discovered, the team updates the product backlog. That means the direction of the product likely shifts. This continuous planning improves the team’s chances of success as it incorporates new knowledge into the experience.
