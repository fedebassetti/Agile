#Time Boxing

##Sprint

The heart of **Scrum** is a Sprint, a time-box of one month or less during which a “Done”, usable, and potentially releasable product Increment is created.

Sprints contain and consist of the **Sprint Planning**, **Daily Scrums**, the development work, the **Sprint Review**, and the **Sprint Retrospective**.

During the Sprint:

* No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal
* Quality goals do not decrease
* Scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team as more is learned.

Each Sprint should be used to accomplish something. Each Sprint has a definition of what is to be built, a design and flexible plan that will guide building it, the work, and the resultant product.

Sprints enable predictability by ensuring inspection and adaptation of progress toward a Sprint Goal at least every calendar month. Sprints also limit risk to the cost associated with a small amount of time (two to four weeks).

##Meetings

**Scrum** formally defines four meetings to help ensure Sprint success:

* [Sprint Planning](meetings.md#sprint-planning)
* [Daily Scrum (Stand-up)](meetings.md#daily-stand-up)
* [Sprint Review](meetings.md#sprint-review)
* [Sprint Retrospective](meetings.md#sprint-retrospective)
    * Not an "official" Scrum meeting: [Backlog Refinement/Grooming](meetings.md#backlog-grooming)
