#Roles

* Product Owner
* Scrum Master
* Scrum Team

##Product Owner

The Product Owner is responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. How this is done may vary widely across organizations, Scrum Teams, and individuals.

The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog. Product Backlog management includes:

* Clearly expressing Product Backlog items
* Ordering the items in the Product Backlog to best achieve goals and missions
* Optimizing the value of the work the Development Team performs
* Ensuring that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next
* Ensuring the Development Team understands items in the Product Backlog to the level needed.
* Focused on the WHAT and not the HOW, the "vision" for where the product should go

The Product Owner is one person, not a committee. The Product Owner may represent the desires of a committee in the Product Backlog, but those wanting to change a Product Backlog item’s priority must address the Product Owner.

For the Product Owner to succeed, the entire organization must respect his or her decisions. The Product Owner’s decisions are visible in the content and ordering of the Product Backlog. No one is allowed to tell the Development Team to work from a different set of requirements, and the Development Team isn’t allowed to act on what anyone else says.

##Scrum Master

The Scrum Master has no management authority. They are not a project manager but rather a facilitator. The term project management is purposely left out of the **Scrum** roles as the Product Owner AND the Scrum team AND the Scrum master should work collaboratively to fill that need on the team.

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and rules.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

###Scrum Master Service to the Product Owner

The Scrum Master serves the Product Owner in several ways, including:

* Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
* Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
* Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
* Ensuring the Product Owner knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
* Understanding and practicing agility
* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed.

###Scrum Master Service to the Development Team

The Scrum Master serves the Development Team in several ways, including:

* Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
* Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
* Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress
* Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
* Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood.

###Scrum Master Service to the Organization

The Scrum Master serves the organization in several ways, including:

* Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
* Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
* Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
* Causing change that increases the productivity of the Scrum Team
* Working with other Scrum Masters to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

##Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of “Done” product at the end of each Sprint.

Scrum Teams are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes the Scrum Team’s overall efficiency and effectiveness.

Scrum Teams have the following characteristics:

* They are self-organizing. No one (not even the Scrum Master) tells the Scrum Team how to turn Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality
* Scrum Teams are cross-functional, with all of the skills as a team necessary to create a product Increment
* Scrum recognizes no titles for Scrum Team members other than Developer, regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule
* Scrum recognizes no sub-teams in the Scrum Team, regardless of particular domains that need to be addressed like testing or business analysis; there are no exceptions to this rule
* Individual Scrum Team members may have specialized skills and areas of focus, but accountability belongs to the Scrum Team as a whole.

A Scrum team should be between 4 and 9 members in total, small enough to remain nimble and large enough to complete significant work within a Sprint. It should be as cross functional as it needs to be to build a potentially shippable product (QA, developers, designers, etc).

Team members should be willing to be responsible for areas of their expertise on a team - though, to reiterate - the entire team is responsible for the deliverables. The team also needs to be able to collaborate with one another in order to discuss changes in direction as they come up. The team should ideally also be constantly learning the product and process (often good feedback can come in the retrospective).
