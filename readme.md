#Agile

##What is Agile?

**Agile development** refers to any development process that is aligned with the concepts of the [Agile Manifesto](./agile-manifesto.md).

**Agile** is a development methodology that:

* is based on iterative development
    * where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
* promotes disciplined project management
* encourages frequent inspection and adaption
* encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability
* is a set of engineering best practices intended to allow for rapid delivery of high quality software
* aligns development with customer needs and company goals

##The Goal

The goal of **Agile** is an early and sustainable rate of delivery.

Early release allows the team to see some features working when it is easy to make adjustments, rather than one massive release at the end.

Sustainablable rate of delivery by introspection and adaptation, and the idea that the work is being done on product rather than a project encourages sustained incremental delivery rates.

##What Agile Is Not

Waterfall software development encourages the team to silo and make important, critical decisions at a point in time when the individuals are the most ignorant about the entirety of the project. It encourages the silod teams to make decsions on:

* Requirements and analysis
* Design
* Code
* Integration
* Testing
* Deployments

one after another with little understanding of the impact decisions will make to "downstream" teams.

##How to "Agile"

Any development process that is inline with these statements is called an Agile process. One such framework is called [Scrum](./scrum/readme.md).
