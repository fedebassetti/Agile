#Agile

##What is Agile?

**Agile development** refers to any development process that is aligned with the concepts of the [Agile Manifesto](./agile-manifesto.md).

**Agile** is a development methodology:

* that is based on iterative development
* where requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration
* promotes disciplined project management
* encourages frequent inspection and adaption
* that encourages teamwork, self-organization and accountability
* a set of engineering best practices intended to allow for rapid delivery of high quality software
* that aligns development with customer needs and company goals

So therefore any development process that is inline with these statements is called an Agile process. One such framework is called [Scrum](./scrum/readme.md).
